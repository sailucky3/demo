Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information</p>

	<p>Consumption at malls is expected to see a further rise in the ongoing quarter aided by the festive season. The upcoming holiday season is expected to give the company's hospitality segment a boost in the second half of the fiscal year. So, investors in the stock need to closely monitor the trends in both these verticals.

"Apart from the addition of new malls over the next couple of years, we believe conclusion of Project Rise will aid significant value unlocking as it is one of the marquee retail assets," said analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd.

Meanwhile, shares of the company hit a new 52-week high of Rs1465.80 on the NSE on 30 September 2022. However, the stock is currently trading at slightly lower levels.</p>

	<p>During our early years in uniform, an illiterate person could join the General Duty category in the Army. We lived through an era when ‘escort’, ‘scout’ and ‘squad’ were pronounced in an identical manner. We had to figure out the right word by relating it to the context.

In the late 1970s, I was commanding a battalion in Nagaland. We were co-located with the Brigade Headquarters at Chakabama, some 30 miles east of the capital, Kohima. There was a station-level cinema hall where a weekly movie was screened. We were responsible for keeping the hall functional for the screening. The movie reel came from Dimapur, where all battalions had their rear locations.
